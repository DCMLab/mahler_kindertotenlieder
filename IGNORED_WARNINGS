	The label 'ii%7' in m. 50, onset 1/4 (MC 51, onset 1/4) is consistent with previous labellings by the annotator and this passage is ambiguous harmonically
    because there are only 2 voices which could imply more than one harmonic representation.

	The label 'ii%65' in m. 70, onset 1/2 (MC 71, onset 1/2) is plausible when considering the last quarter beat is taken as a big passing chord.
