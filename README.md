# Gustav Mahler – Kindertotenlieder

This corpus of annotated [MuseScore](https://musescore.org) files has been created within
the [DCML corpus initiative](https://github.com/DCMLab/dcml_corpora) and employs
the [DCML harmony annotation standard](https://github.com/DCMLab/standards).
It represents the canonical voice-and-piano edition of Mahler's 1904 orchestral song cycle after Rückert. This work,
along with the contemporaneous Rückert-Lieder and Symphony no. 5, represent an introversion of the composer's style
alongside an increase in harmonic experimentation. This trend is reflected in our annotations by the presence of complex
non-standard contrapuntal patterns within single harmonies as well as in prolongating, non-cadential chord successions.
In expanding the possibilities of chromatic elaboration and free organization of functional harmonies, these phenomena
illustrate a connection between 19th- and 20th-century styles represented elsewhere in the Distant Listening Corpus.

## Scores

These piano scores were downloaded from the wonderful [OpenScore Lieder](https://musescore.com/user/27638568/sets/5051725) project. They correspond to the ca.1911 Universal Edition printing of the vocal score. Staff spacing, paginations, and margins were modified to improve the readability of the annotations.
